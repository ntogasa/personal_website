# personal_website

This repository holds the code behind my own personal web application. It serves three functions:
1) introduce myself
2) showcase my work
3) provide a means to contact me

## Built using:

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (open source Python web framework)
- [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) (CSS Framework) with some custom CSS
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store and serve static and media files
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the project database
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) (Cloud platform for deployment)
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) (Web security and performance)

I was able to utilize all of these frameworks/services for free.

I leveraged the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get a free 'Hobby' dyno from Heroku for 2 years (which otherwise would cost $7/month). I did this to get SSL protection for my website, which is not necessary but recommended.

The one thing I did end up paying for was the domain name (via Name.com), which cost ~$11.00 for a year.
