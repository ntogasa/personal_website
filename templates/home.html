            <h1 class="page-heading">Hi</h1><br>
            I'm a science writer. <br>
            Pretty vague title eh? <br><br>
            Well, let me break it down a bit. What I do is:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>I go out into the world, talk to experts, and pull important details from the interviews.</li>
                <li>I drink coffee...responsibly...
                <li>I translate arcane jargon into actual words.</li>
                <li>I keep up to date on potential leads (AKA I check my email, and actually respond to them too).</li>
                <li>I take pictures. Sometimes video.</li>
                <li>I keep my audience in mind, no matter how broad or narrow.</li>
                <li>I do all of this to produce stories about interesting and relevant scientific discoveries and projects.</li>
                <li>And I always make my deadline.</li>
            </ul>
            So, now you know. <br>
            But if you'd like to learn more about me or my work,<br>
            feel free to click around.<br>
            Or <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">reach out to me</a>, and we can talk. <br>
            Thanks for dropping by.<br><br>
