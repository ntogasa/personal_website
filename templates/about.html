                    I'm a science writer and graduate student in the University of California Santa Cruz
                    Science Communiation Program. At the moment I write for the
                    Monterey Herald, and mostly report on environmental issues.

                    My background is in rocks and earthquakes. While earning my masters degree in geology from
                    McGill University, I studied how ancient earthquakes formed large gold deposits in Quebec. Before
                    that I worked at the United State Geological Survey, and investigated how a geothermal energy
                    field was actively deforming the surrounding landscape.

                    Computer programming has been a hobby of mine for years, and I am interested in learning to apply
                    my skills to journalism. I have experience with web scraping, data visualization, back end web
                    design, and database management.

                    Thanks for stopping by, feel free to reach out to me anytime.
