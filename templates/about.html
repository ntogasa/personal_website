                    Nikk Ogasa grew up along the coast of southern California, where he developed a healthy fear of the open
                    water. He spent his school breaks fly-fishing and backpacking in the Sierra Nevada, which ingrained in him
                    a fierce (and perhaps obsessive) passion for wild landscapes and the natural world. <br><br>

                    In 2015, he earned a
                    B.S. in Earth Science from the University of California Santa Cruz, and in 2020 he managed to pull himself
                    together and submit a thesis to earn a M.S. in Geology from McGill University. There are also rumors that
                    he spent some time conducting research on earthquakes at the United States Geological Survey.<br><br>

                    Now he is a self-proclaimed science writer, motivated by his love for nature and science to share stories
                    that educate and inspire the public. He lives in Santa Cruz, CA, where he is (supposedly)
                    working hard towards a M.S. in Science Communication at UC Santa Cruz.<br><br>

                    When he's not writing about science,
                    stumbling around in the mountains,
                    fiddling with a Python script,
                    or rolling around on a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu mat,
                    he's plucking away clumsily at a banjo.
