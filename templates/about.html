                    Hey. I'm a science journalist, and I live in Santa Cruz, CA.
                    <br><br>
                    I grew up in a sleepy, coastal town in Southern California.
                    Rocky bluffs and sandy beaches were my world, until my first trip to the Sierra Nevada.
                    From then on, juniper trees and stark granite cliffs were always on my mind.
                    My obsession with the mountains drew me into my first university geology course, which promised a field trip to Owens Valley.
                    I knew I would love the camping, but I didn’t know I would fall in love with earth science, or that rocks would take over the next seven years of my life.
                    <br><br>
                    But no complaints here, my rock hounding career was great.
                    I wrestled with computer models at the United States Geological Survey and explored an underground gold during my masters research.
                    I traveled to faraway lands like Spain, Mongolia, and Nepal, and forged close relationships with colleagues who I will remain friends with for the rest of my life.
                    <br><br>
                    But somewhere along the way I realized that academia just was not the walk for me.
                    What I truly enjoyed was sharing science with others, and I had always been inspired by the books of John McPhee.
                    I decided to try my own hand at writing, and before I knew it, I had enrolled as a graduate student in the UC Santa Cruz Science Communication program.
                    <br><br>
                    So now here I am, writing stories about science and the environment.
                    I might not be licking rocks like a true geologist anymore, but I still remember what drew me down that path at the beginning—a love for the mountains.
                    Now, I’m hoping my writing will similarly inspire others to appreciate science and nature.
