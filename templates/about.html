                    Nikk grew up on the coast of southern California, where he developed a healthy fear of the open
                    water. He spent his school breaks fly-fishing and backpacking in the Sierra Nevada, and fostered
                    a fierce (and perhaps obsessive) passion for wild landscapes and the natural world. <br><br>

                    In 2015, he earned a
                    B.S. in Earth Science from the University of California Santa Cruz, and in 2020
                    a M.S. in Geology from McGill University. Somewhere in between, he puzzled over earthquakes
                    at the United States Geological Survey in the Induced Seismicity Group.<br><br>

                    Now he's writing about science and the environment, and hoping that people will read his stuff and
                    learn something or care about more about the world we share.
                    He lives in Santa Cruz, CA, where he's (supposedly)
                    working hard towards a M.S. in Science Communication at UC Santa Cruz.<br><br>

                    When he's not writing about science,
                    stumbling around in the mountains,
                    fiddling with a Python script,
                    or rolling around on a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu mat,
                    he's plucking away clumsily at a banjo.
