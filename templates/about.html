                    Nikk Ogasa grew up on the coast of southern California, where he developed a healthy fear of the open
                    water. He spent his school breaks hooking trout and tripping on rocks in the Sierra Nevada, and
                    fostered a fierce fascination for wild landscapes and the natural world. In university he followed
                    this passion by majoring in geology, and studying rocks has been an integral part of his life ever since.<br><br>

                    Geology has taken him around the globe, from the blistering sands of the Gobi desert
                    to quiet towns in the Pyrenees mountains. He spent two weeks exploring an underground gold mine
                    in rural Quebec (in the winter!), collecting rocks for his masters thesis work at McGill University.
                    Although conditions were sometimes rough, Nikk loved geoscience. After all, what could compare
                    to unearthing stories millions of years old?<br><br>

                    Today he's still chasing stories about the natural world, with a focus on science and the environment.
                    You can find him in Santa Cruz, California, where he's chipping away at a
                    M.S. in Science Communication at U.C. Santa Cruz.<br><br>

                    When he's not writing stories,
                    losing his way in the mountains,
                    fiddling with a Python script,
                    or rolling around on a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu mat,
                    he's plucking away (poorly) at a banjo.
