                    Nikk grew up on the coast of southern California, where he developed a healthy fear of the open
                    water. He spent his school breaks hooking trout and tripping on rocks in the Sierra Nevada, and fostered
                    a fierce (and perhaps obsessive) passion for wild landscapes and the natural world. <br><br>

                    In 2015, he wrestled a B.S. in Earth Science from the University of California Santa Cruz, and in 2020
                    surprised everyone (including himself) with a M.S. in Geology from McGill University.
                    Somewhere along the way, he puzzled over earthquakes
                    at the United States Geological Survey's Earthquake Science Center.<br><br>

                    Now he's writing about science and the environment to share his love for the natural world.
                    He lives in Santa Cruz, CA, where he's clawing and scratching his way towards a
                    M.S. in Science Communication at UC Santa Cruz.<br><br>

                    When he's not writing about science,
                    losing his way in the mountains,
                    fiddling with a Python script,
                    or rolling around on a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu mat,
                    he's plucking away clumsily at a banjo.
